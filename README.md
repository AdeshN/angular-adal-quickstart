# ng2-adal Quickstart
The very well known updated Angular Quickstart repository updated with ng2-adal, a module based on angular2-adal, a very well written library that is known to cause some pains because of rapid breaking changes in Angular.

This one works and I am currently using this for a personal project.

 Please let me know in case of bugs/issues.
